= 3. First Mule 4 Project – Conceptual Overview

After practically creating a simple flow, we now move on to a conceptual analysis of what we have actually done and introduce the basic concepts of the Mule platform.

In this section, we shift the focus from working through clicks in Anypoint Studio to understanding how Mule operates beneath the surface.
The goal is to grasp what happens in the background when a Mule application receives a request, processes data, and returns a response.

This conceptual perspective enables building more complex Mule projects on solid foundations, rather than relying solely on visually arranging components without deeper understanding of their behavior.
