= 1. General Overview of Mule

== What is MuleSoft and what problem does it solve

MuleSoft offers one of the most widespread integration platforms for connecting SaaS and enterprise applications in cloud and on-premise environments.
In other words, MuleSoft is a platform that provides IT departments with tools for automatic system and data integration, accelerating workflows and creating digital experiences – all on a single, simple platform.

In modern enterprises, there are many different systems (ERP, CRM, databases, cloud services, internal and external applications) that need to exchange data.
MuleSoft solves the problem of connecting these diverse systems by providing a scalable, secure, and maintainable integration platform.

== What is Mule 4

At the core of the MuleSoft platform is the *Mule 4 runtime* – an integration engine and development platform for building integration applications and APIs.
Mule 4 is written in Java and is based on an *event-driven architecture (EDA)*; it is a lightweight and scalable engine that automatically manages thread and event execution.

For the developer, this means the focus can shift from low-level details (such as threads, sockets, and memory) to designing integration flows (*flows*) and business logic.

Technically speaking, the Mule runtime uses proven Java technologies in the background (e.g., it is built on the Spring framework), but the developer does not write a traditional Java application.
Mule provides a higher level of abstraction through visually composing integration components.
The goal is to build integrations declaratively and faster, with minimal so-called *“glue” code*.

Mule 4 represents the evolution of the Mule 3 runtime.
It retains the same key elements (applications, flows, connectors, DataWeave, etc.) but introduces a simpler message model and a richer set of capabilities, so there are fewer concepts to learn and maintain.

== Development tools and platform

The official development environment for Mule is *Anypoint Studio* – an Eclipse-based IDE, customized for visually designing Mule applications.

In Anypoint Studio:

* we create Mule projects,
* add connectors from a rich palette (over 200 ready connectors for systems such as Salesforce, SAP, Workday, databases, and others),
* develop flows using drag-and-drop and component configuration.

Studio comes with all necessary runtime elements (embedded Mule server, pre-installed JDK and Maven) and enables local testing and debugging of applications.

MuleSoft has also introduced *Anypoint Code Builder* – a new generation IDE based on the Visual Studio Code platform.
Code Builder provides the same functionalities as Studio but is available:

* as a VS Code extension (desktop),
* as a cloud IDE within the Anypoint Platform.

This allows developing Mule applications directly in the browser with connection to an Anypoint account, which brings additional flexibility, especially for teamwork and working on different operating systems.

Besides local development, MuleSoft provides a central platform for deploying and managing applications – *Anypoint Platform*.

Within the platform, *CloudHub* represents the cloud environment (MuleSoft’s iPaaS) where Mule applications can be deployed with one click or scripted.

The typical development cycle looks like this:

. develop and test locally in Anypoint Studio,
. deploy the application to CloudHub (sandbox or production),
. manage the application through Anypoint Platform tools (e.g., Runtime Manager).

Studio is directly integrated with the Anypoint Platform, enabling application deployment to the cloud directly from the IDE.
Local development and cloud execution are not separate processes but part of a unified development cycle.

== MuleSoft community and certification

Formal certification is not mandatory to start working with MuleSoft.
However, *MuleSoft Certified Developer (MCD) Level 1* represents a good indicator of the basic knowledge expected from a Mule developer.

It is recommended to use the domains covered by this certification as a guide through the material, including:

* working in Anypoint Studio,
* flow development,
* using connectors,
* basic data transformations,
* error handling.

The certificate serves as a knowledge check, but learning the technology can begin without it.

Official MuleSoft documentation offers a large number of free resources:

* Trailhead modules,
* official tutorials,
* community forums,

which significantly help beginners master the Mule 4 platform.
